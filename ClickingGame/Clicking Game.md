### Make A Folder
Before you start copying code, we need to make a folder!
Name it whatever you want but maybe "ClickingGame" so you know what it is.

### Download bg.png
Next download bg.png and move it into the folder you just made.

### Copy & Paste Code!
Now we can start copying some code!
We will be working from two .py files to pay attention to which file you need to copy the code into!!

### Step 1, imports
We need to add out imports to both of our files
File 1:
```
import gui, time, random, pygame
```
Save and name this file "main.py"

File 2:
```
import pygame, sys, time
from pygame.locals import *
```
Save and name this file "gui.py"

### Step 2:
#### main.py
```

```







### Challenges
#### Challenge 1
In "main.py", look at class "RunningButton".
There are 3 things you can tinker with... maybe changing the size of the buttons
